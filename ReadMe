In this research, we propose an Artificial Neural Network based model built in MATLAB to analyse and classify medical data from the Wisconsin database to prognose and diagnose breast cancer. This paper presents the different stages we have been through to create to create the network and examines the chosen methods and algorithms used in the implementation. Various techniques can be used to produce different desired accuracies. Therefore, this research paper seeks to provide the suitable for the Artificial Neural Network number of neurons/layers and it demonstrates the implementation of training, testing and validation (in our case 4-fold cross-validation) of the model. Finally, we present and analyse the results of the trained network.
